> RSS3 is a next-generation feed standard that aims to support efficient and decentralized information distribution.

![RSS3](https://badge.rss3.workers.dev/)

We've seen the Web1 era when everyone was happy to use RSS as a standard format for syndication and the Web2 era when RSS declined and the closure of information between platforms are created.

We all agree that information should be more freely distributed in the Web3 era, and to facilitate this we need a common format that we can all use to syndicate information, reducing the cost of use and development.
