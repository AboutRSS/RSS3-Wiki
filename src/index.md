tagline: Derived from the best out of RSS, RSS3 is an open protocol designed for all cyber existence.
actionText: Quick Start →
actionLink: /protocol/
features:
- title: Open
  details: It goes without saying that the whole RSS3 project, including the protocol itself and all other supporting layers like hosting and indexing should be open source and participatory for all.
- title: Distributed
  details: The ultimate distributed control is to have every cyber persona control its own data. And this means both indexing files and content file should be under distributed hosting, and the right to edit the files are determined by their key pairs.
- title: Inclusive
  details: We need the protocol to support very different types of functionalities and applications so that innovations can continue to happen.
